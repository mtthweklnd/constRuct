\title{This function serializes a log object (like one from `start_pipeline_log`)
and uploads it to a specified container in Azure Blob Storage. It is
configured to connect to a local Azurite emulator by default.}
\usage{
write_log_to_blob(blob_container, log_object, blob_name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{log_object}{The R object (e.g., a tibble or list) to be saved.}

\item{blob_name}{A character string for the name of the blob. A default name
is generated using the pipeline name and timestamp if not provided.}

\item{container_name}{A character string for the name of the blob container.}

\item{connection_string}{The connection string for Azure Storage. It is
highly recommended to use the default, which pulls from the
`AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the path to the uploaded blob.
