Description: Provides a suite of functions to streamline and standardize Extract, 
    Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines. This package simplifies pipeline setup 
    by managing database (Azure SQL, SQLite) and remote storage connections. 
    It features a dual-logging system for both high-level run metadata and 
    granular, step-by-step operational logs using 'log4r'. Includes 
    helpers for integrating 'pointblank' data validation checks and linking 
    their reports back to the pipeline's metadata log, ensuring data 
    quality and run traceability.
